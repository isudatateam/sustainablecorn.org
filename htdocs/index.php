<p><strong>Climate Change, Mitigation, and Adaptation in Corn-based Cropping Systems
<br />
USDA-NIFA A3101 Regional Approaches to Climate Change Cropping systems: cereal production systems (corn)

<p>This project, begun February 2011, consists of a team from 12 institutions across nine states in the 
Heartland (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin) 
which will address the societal challenge to mitigate and adapt the North Central cornâ€“based 
cropping system to climate change.  <strong>The vision is to create a coordinated functional 
network to develop science-based knowledge on climate mitigation and adaptation that informs 
policy development and guides on-farm, watershed level, and public decision making.</strong> Standardized 
protocols and a network of 21 carefully-selected sites will be used to provide baseline measurements 
on greenhouse gases, carbon, nitrogen and water usage data and to evaluate a suite of crop management 
practices.  These include tillage, cover crops, crop rotations, drainage water management and enhanced 
nitrogen management techniques.  Data from these sites will be archived in a central database and used
 in conjunction with public climate data.  Physical, climate, sociological and economic models will be 
 applied in an iterative way to establish strengths and weaknesses of a set of cropping practices.  
 Life cycle analyses, social, and economic findings will be used to develop public policy 
 recommendations and engage producers and stakeholders in managing for climate uncertainty and 
 environmental sustainability. This project integrates research, extension and education, builds 
 capacity for extension to address climate change needs of stakeholders, and prepares the next 
 generation of scientists for interdisciplinary research on the intersection of agriculture and climate. </p>

<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Develop standardized methodologies for estimating C, N, and water footprints of corn 
production in the region and perform baseline monitoring.</li>

<li>Perform field tests across 21 baseline sites in eight states to evaluate the impacts 
of a suite of crop management practices (including no-till, extended crop rotations, 
drainage water management, cover crops, and canopy N-sensors) on C, N, and water footprints.</li>
 
<li>Apply climate and physical models to synthesize results from the field tests and extend 
them to predict climate and economic scenarios.</li>

<li>Perform comprehensive life cycle analyses (LCA) of the proposed practices and evaluate the 
socio-economic-environmental willingness of producers and farmers to adopt new cropping systems 
through feedback loops between social science research, biophysical field research, monitoring, 
and modeling of agricultural production systems.</li>

<li>Integrate education, extension, outreach, and stakeholder participation across all 
aspects of the program. Focus will be on place-based education and outreach programs. 
Farmers will participate via <a href="http://i-farmtools.org/">I-FARM</a>, an interactive tool to 
analyze the economic, agronomic, and social acceptability of these practices.</li>
