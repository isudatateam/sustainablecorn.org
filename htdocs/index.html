            <h2>Find out what Sustainable Corn Project <em>Next Generation Scientist</em>s are doing now</h2>
            <hr />
            <p><em>The project&rsquo;s  operations team wishes to send their appreciation to all the young scientists  who participated in the Sustainable Corn Project as a post-doc or while working  on their master&rsquo;s degree or doctorate. The following is a snapshot of what some  of them are now doing.</em></p>
            <p><strong>Becky Bailey</strong>…earned her master&rsquo;s degree in  agronomy, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, while participating in the  &ldquo;middle years&rdquo; of the Sustainable Corn Project (2012-2014). She&rsquo;s currently a  lab technician in the biology department at West Valley College in Saratoga,  California. She and other biology faculty at West Valley appreciate her well-rounded  sustainability/environmental/agricultural perspective that the Sustainable Corn  Project helped foster. </p>
            <p><strong>Andrea Basche</strong>…earned a doctorate in crop  production and physiology and sustainable agriculture, from Iowa State  University, in the fall of 2015. She participated in the Sustainable Corn  Project from its start in 2011. She now works as a research fellow for the  Union of Concerned Scientists&rsquo; (USC) Food and Environment Program, in  Washington, D.C. Andrea says her project experience was &ldquo;a huge benefit in  securing her current position.&rdquo; Her work with the project—specifically  experimental design, modeling approaches and her research results—shaped her  thinking on how to approach her current research. It also provided her &ldquo;with a  wide network of experts and cohort of students&rdquo; whose expertise she can  continue to tap.  </p>
            <p><strong>Aaron Daigh</strong>…worked six months as a post doc  on the Sustainable Corn Project. He had just finished his doctorate in soil  science and environmental sciences at Iowa State University when he joined Dr.  Helmers&rsquo; research group in the spring of 2013. He&rsquo;s now an assistant professor  of soil physics in the Soil Science Department at North Dakota State  University. Aaron says his participation in the project helped him get his  current position. &ldquo;The Sustainable Corn Project helps students demonstrate to  potential employers their ability to collaborate, get along with others and be  a good team member.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Trevor Frank</strong>…earned a master&rsquo;s degree in agronomy  at Purdue while participating in the Sustainable Corn Project. He is currently  a research assistant and product development specialist at  Illinois Foundation Seeds, Inc. (IFSI), at their Plover, Wisconsin research station.  IFSI works on making new varieties of sweet corn. Trevor says his master&rsquo;s  degree and research experience with the project helped him get his current  position. &ldquo;The research techniques I learned from the Sustainable Corn Project team  and Dr. Kladivko at Purdue have greatly helped me in performing daily duties  here at IFSI.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Linda Geiger</strong>…earned a master&rsquo;s degree in  agricultural and biosystems engineering while participating in the Sustainable Corn Project.  She&rsquo;s now a doctoral student and has an extension assistantship at the  University of Nebraska-Lincoln. &ldquo;The Sustainable Corn Project definitely  influenced my career goals. I recently was selected to lead an  interdisciplinary team of extension educators and specialists who will focus on  research and programming on soil health.&rdquo; </p>
            <p><strong>Samuel Haruna</strong>…earned a master&rsquo;s degree while  participating in the project in 2013. He is now finishing up his Ph.D.  dissertation and will begin a fellowship at Middle Tennessee State University  in Murfreesboro, in August. Samuel says the Sustainable Corn Project provided  some experience he needed for his current fellowship. </p>
            <p><strong>Caroline Hughes</strong>…earned an MSE—master&rsquo;s in  engineering—from Purdue University. She now works at Epic Systems Corporation  in Madison, Wisconsin, a health records system, guiding hospital IT staff in maintaining  their systems. Caroline says the research and communication skills she honed  while participating in the project are a big part of being successful at her  current job. Working with agricultural monitoring data gave her &ldquo;a lot more  confidence and knowledge of programming&rdquo; that she now uses, and being on a  research team and practicing an investigative process helped her identify her  current job as a &ldquo;good match.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Ainis Lagzdins</strong>…says he &ldquo;gained valuable  experience&rdquo; that he can use in his present research and academic work. He&rsquo;s  currently an associate professor at Latvia University of Agriculture,  Department of Environmental Engineering and Water Management. Ainis says, &ldquo;The Sustainable Corn  Project provided me with an opportunity to do a postdoctoral research in the  U.S. This stay stimulated a tenure process when a position of associate  professor was obtained. Also, due to my research activities within the project,  I was highly evaluated in the annual evaluation of&nbsp;researchers at Latvia  University of Agriculture.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Dinesh Panday</strong>…received his master&rsquo;s degree in the summer of 2015, from Lincoln University-Missouri. He&rsquo;s currently a Ph.D. student in  the Department of Agronomy and Horticulture at University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  He is focusing his on cropping systems in dryland and irrigated fields for soil  and nutrient management, with the application of models to quantify microbial  production of greenhouse gas emissions. He says, &quot;the Sustainable Corn  Project helps students for networking, sharing of research activities, and to  develop leadership capacity through a workshop series and  conferences.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>José Pantoja</strong>…earned a doctorate in agronomy  from Iowa State University and was a post doc for a few months after  graduation. During that time he continued to work on the project. He has  returned to his native Ecuador. &ldquo;First I was working with the government in an  academic-research project at the university level where I did some teaching and  conducted research regarding fertilizer use and management in Ecuadorian crops.  I also provided training for agronomists, university professors, research technicians,  and farmers,&rdquo; says José. This past January, he launched his own business, consulting  about crop and soil&nbsp;management with an emphasis in soil fertility,  fertilizer use, and plant nutrition. He also continues to collaborate with  universities and research institutions. José says he employs all the knowledge  and experiences he got while working as a part of the Sustainable Corn Project,  in his current work. &ldquo;For example, I have used all the things I learned about  cover crops for teaching farmers in Ecuador about soil conservation and crop  management.&rdquo;</p>
            <p><strong>Gabrielle Roesch</strong>…earned a doctorate in sociology  and sustainable agriculture, from Iowa State University, while participating in  the Sustainable Corn Project. She is currently a Climate Hub Fellow with the  Northwest Regional Climate Hub, based in Corvallis, Oregon. In her current  position, she works with farmers, forest landowners, federal agencies, and  other partners to address climate change impacts on working lands. Gabrielle  says, &ldquo;I absolutely would not have been competitive for this job without my Sustainable  Corn Project experience.&rdquo;<br />

<h3><strong>Effectively Engaging Producers in Conservation Conversations</strong></h3>

<p>Farmers are more uncertain today than 25 years ago about the  effectiveness of conservation practices. While that may be discouraging, it  also means extension educators and others have an opportunity to share new scientific findings, learn from farmers about what's working and what's not working, and assist them to better  manage the natural resources upon which they rely. Emphasis of this webinar  recording, which originally aired on February 16, includes findings on farmer  uncertainty about conservation practices, using social norms to leverage  practices that address off field/off farm nutrient losses, and how the language  of conservation can influence social learning and behavior change. The  presenter is Lois Wright Morton, sociology professor and the Director of the  Sustainable Corn Project. The webinar recording is available at the USDA NRCS  Science and Technology website at the following link: <a href="http://www.conservationwebinars.net/webinars/effectively-engaging-producers-in-conservation-conversations">http://www.conservationwebinars.net/webinars/effectively-engaging-producers-in-conservation-conversations</a>.</p>
