				<h1>About the Project</h1>
       
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A transdisciplinary team is focusing on mitigation and adaptation strategies within corn-based cropping systems in response to long-term weather variability. A network of more than 20 sites across the region provides baseline measurements on greenhouse gases, carbon, nitrogen and water usage. The team is assessing the dominant corn-soybean rotation and a variety of crop management practices including tillage, cover crops, extended crop rotations, drainage water management and nitrogen management techniques. Data from each site are recorded in a central database and available to all team members.</p>
                <p>Researchers are applying physical, climatic, and socio-economic models to derive the data's "real world" implications. Team members are studying social and economic findings, working directly with producers and stakeholders to develop crop management practices that consider climate uncertainty and environmental sustainability. Researchers are also assessing the data's social role and how changes in public policy could affect the models. Extension and education will transfer what the team learns to science teachers and farmers.</p>
                
                <h3>Participants</h3>
                <p>Ten land grant universities and two USDA Agricultural Research Service laboratories are participating in this project. These 12 institutions represent nine states in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin).</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Iowa State University</li>
                    <li>Lincoln University</li>
                    <li>Michigan State University</li>
                    <li>The Ohio State University</li>
                    <li>Purdue University</li>
                    <li>University of Illinois</li>
                    <li>University of Minnesota</li>
                    <li>University of Missouri</li>
                    <li>University of Wisconsin</li>
                    <li>USDA Agricultural Research Service – Columbus, Ohio</li>
                    <li>USDA Agricultural Research Service – Coshocton, Ohio</li>
                    <li>South Dakota State University</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This innovative project is a true partnership among USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture, the Agriculture Research Service and the North Central Region land grant universities to promote the productivity and ecosystem resilience of corn-based cropping systems. Participants are placing a strong emphasis in creating connections among their research, working with producers to encourage resilient decision-making, and training the next generation of scientists to work collaboratively and across disciplines. </p>
                <p>The team is comprised of biophysical and social scientists including soil scientists, agronomists, entomologists, plant pathologists, sociologists, economists, agricultural engineers, crop modelers and climatologists as well as classroom educators and extension specialists. This project directly involves farmers and local watershed groups across the region who are actively engaged in co-learning with the scientific team.</p>
                
                <h3>Objectives</h3>
                <ol>
                	<li>Develop standardized methodologies and perform baseline monitoring of carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints.</li>
                    <li>Perform field tests to evaluate the impacts of various crop management practices on carbon, nitrogen, and water footprints.</li>
                    <li>Apply models to data to predict possible climate and economic scenarios and outcomes.</li>
                    <li>Perform analyses of the various practices and evaluate the willingness of producers and farmers to adopt new cropping systems.</li>
                    <li>Integrate education, extension, outreach, and stakeholder participation across all aspects of the program.</li>
                </ol>
