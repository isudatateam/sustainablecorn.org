Hatfield</strong> currently serves as the Laboratory Director for the National Laboratory for  Agriculture and the Environment, Ames, Iowa, and Director of the Midwest  Climate Hub. With a background in agricultural climatology, Dr. Hatfield has  focused his research on soil-plant-environment interactions and quantifying the  effect of weather and climate on crop productivity. He knows farmers and  producers deal with the weather every year and they have the tools to decrease  their variation in crop production by ensuring their soil is in the best state  possible to supply water and nutrients to the crop. His vision is to build  climate resilient cropping systems by creating a whole new understanding of the  genetics x environment x management interactions.</td>
