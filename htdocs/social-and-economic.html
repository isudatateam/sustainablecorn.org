<h3>Overview</h3>
        		<p>This objective focuses on <a href="img/social-and-economic/Social-Science-Flowchart-web-full.png" target="_blank">farmer capacity and willingness to adopt management practices and strategies</a> that lead to long-term sustainability and productivity of corn-based cropping systems under variable weather and long-term climate changes.</p>
                <p>This objective utilizes sociological and economic theories and methods to gather data on Midwestern farmers' beliefs, attitudes, and management strategies. It studies farmers' awareness of long-term weather patterns and the impacts they have on their adaptive and mitigative actions. Findings from this objective provide a feedback loop to the field trials and modeling objectives and a framework for developing tools for farmer decision-making, education curricula and science-based policies.</p>
                <p>The intent of Objective 4 is achieved primarily through survey research and participatory farm-level climate scenario analysis and economic assessment of cropping systems.</p>


		<h3>2011 CSCAP-U2U Farmer Survey</h3> 
     
		<p>CSCAP researchers worked with the USDA-supported <a href="http://drinet.hubzero.org/u2uproject" target="_blank">Useful to Usable (U2U) Climate project</a> based at Purdue University to survey nearly 20,000 farmers in 22 HUC6 watersheds across 10 Corn Belt states. The survey features an innovative approach, exemplified through the following:
			<ul>
            	<li>The survey uses the watershed as the sampling unit, which to CSCAP's knowledge has never been done at this scale.</li>
                <li>Because NASS is conducting the survey, they will be able to populate the data set with data from the Census of Agriculture. This will be the first survey ever conducted that will be able to link complex attitudinal measures with the detailed agricultural enterprise data from the Census of Agriculture.</li></ul></p>
        <p>Twenty-two HUC6 watersheds located in what the USDA defines as "major crop areas" for corn and soybeans in the Corn Belt were surveyed.  Watershed selection criteria were developed to prioritize watersheds. It was decided to select the top ten watersheds in terms of corn and soybean production. The next five watersheds were selected based on acreage under irrigation. The final seven watersheds were selected based primarily on
ecological grounds (e.g., watershed 070600, the so-called "Driftless Area," which was selected due to its uniquely sensitive geologic and ecological features). The following figure maps the watersheds that were surveyed.</p>

   <h3>Farmer Interviews</h3>
   <p>The 20 CSCAP extension educators will use in-depth interviews with 200+ farmers to gather data and foster educational opportunities to increase farmer knowledge and inspire learning about connections between management practices, climate variability, soil erosion, nutrient runoff, and atmospheric, economic and environmental impacts..</p>
   <p>Investigators and extension educators will be conducting one-on-one interviews to examine the biophysical and financial characteristics of farmer's current operations and compare them to land-use scenarios that include various innovative, adaptive and mitigative practices that would be appropriate for their land. This approach will provide real-farm platforms for structured climate- and agriculture-related discussions between extension educators and producers. This information will help gauge farmer willingness and capacity to adopt alternative cropping practices.</p>
