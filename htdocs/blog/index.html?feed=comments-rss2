		<description><![CDATA[We are involved in this issue not only as farmers, but also by started a group in 2012 call &quot;Soil Organic Matter Generators&quot; or S.O.M. Generators. We do presentations as training for the NRCS/SWCD&#039;s, Local Watersheds, and other Ag related businesses.  We recently had the Heirs and Foundation boards of the McKnight Foundation and the Sam Walton Foundation learning about Soil Regeneration and Cover Crops. We have agreed to participate in a 7 state study by U of Purdue based CTIC.  We are also hoping to write a book starting this Winter titled SOIL REGENERATION &quot;Growing Your Soil&quot;]]></description>
