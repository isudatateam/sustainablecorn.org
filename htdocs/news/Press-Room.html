    <p><strong>Sustainable Corn Project Awarded Top Honors by USDA</strong></p>
    <p>October 7, 2016</p>
    <p>AMES, Iowa  â€” Lois Wright Morton, an Iowa State University sociology professor, was presented  the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s National Institute of Food and Agriculture  Partnership Award Oct. 6.</p>
    <p>She accepted  the award on behalf of the Climate Change, Mitigation and Adaption in  Corn-based Cropping Systems team, which Wright Morton directs. The multi-state project  was honored for supporting NIFA&rsquo;s vision to catalyze transformative discovers,  education, and engagement to address agricultural challenges.</p>
    <p>In March  2011, Wright Morton convened a nine-state, 11-institution partnership to  discover, engage, publish and teach strategies farmers can put in place  throughout the Corn Belt to make corn-based cropping systems more resilient to  current and predicted impacts of climate change. Project participants included  140 scientists, 86 graduate students, 133 undergraduates and 18 extension  educators and outreach watershed coordinators. In addition, 159 farmers partnered with team  scientists and educators to share their knowledge and learn from project  research.</p>
    <p>The United  States produces 41 percent of the world&rsquo;s corn, of which more than 60 percent  is grown in the upper Midwest. An increasingly variable climate and increases  in frequency and intensity of rainfall in this Corn Belt threaten crop  production and degradation of soil and water resources.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Farmers were critical partners in the project. Our  findings reinforce and reflect this partnership,&rdquo; said Wright Morton. &ldquo;We found  that adapting corn-based cropping systems to climate extremes will require  farmers to experiment and evaluate established and new practices based on the  soil and topography in their fields, their changing micro climate, and their  personal resources, skills, values and goals.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The project  was funded for five years by a $20 million USDA-NIFA grant. Wright Morton and  her team sought additional institutional partners and obtained an additional  $25 million to expand the project&rsquo;s research to include soybean production,  impact of practices on crop pests and disease, water use efficiency in organic  corn production and social-economic factors that promote or impede adoption of  the management practices being studied. </p>
    <p>Research data, from the management practices being  studied, were collected over five years from 35 field research sites in the  Corn Belt and were integrated with climate science data. The management  practices were evaluated by multi-disciplinary teams of project researchers.  The practices were: corn-soybean rotation, cereal rye cover crops within the  corn-soybean rotation, extended and diverse crop rotations, organic corn  cropping systems, drainage water management, canopy nitrogen sensing, tillage  management (no-till and conventional) and landscape position. Results included  119 scientific findings and 59 recommendations. </p>
    <p>Research findings have been reported in 154 refereed  journal articles, 212 extension publications and 995 presentations to farmers,  farm advisers, K-12 educators and others, resulting in a total audience reach  of approximately 90,000 individuals. All findings and recommendations are being  compiled into technical reports for future use by scientists, farm advisers,  and extension educators and administrators.</p>
    <p>A  legacy of educational publications and videos for agricultural stakeholders and  educators have been made available via Midwest Regional Climate Centers; the  National Council for Science and the Environment&rsquo;s website for K-12 educators;  and Midwestern, land-grant university extension online stores, (for an example,  see <a href="http://store.extension.iastate.edu/Topic/Crops/Climate-and-Agriculture">http://store.extension.iastate.edu/Topic/Crops/Climate-and-Agriculture</a>). </p>
    <p>The  project&rsquo;s database and infrastructure are being extended as project  investigators develop new teams and build on the research. The database houses  some of the most comprehensive systems-level data collected on Midwest  agricultural systems and will be made public in 2017 at the USDA National  Agricultural Library. </p>
    <p>Participating institutions included Iowa State University, Lincoln University, in  Missouri; Michigan State University; Ohio State University; Purdue University; South  Dakota State University; University of Illinois; University of Minnesota; University  of Missouri; University of Wisconsin; and the USDA Agricultural Research  Service in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
    <p>Participation  in the project launched the careers of many of the graduate students. To learn  about what they are doing now and to learn more about this project, see <a href="http://www.sustainablecorn.org">www.sustainablecorn.org</a>. </p>
